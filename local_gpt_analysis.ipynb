    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **local large language models** to analyze medical data using plain English questions. Unlike cloud-based AI services, everything runs on your computer, ensuring complete data privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach Matters for Medical Students:\n",
    "- 🔒 **Complete Privacy**: Your data never leaves your computer\n",
    "- 💬 **Natural Language**: Ask questions in plain English, no complex coding required\n",
    "- 🏥 **Medical Context**: Perfect for exploring healthcare datasets securely\n",
    "- 📊 **Instant Analysis**: Get immediate insights and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes:\n",
    "- **Always consult your PI** about methods, devices, and approach before analyzing real data\n",
    "- This method complements other data science techniques covered in separate notebooks\n",
    "- The local model (qwen3) works on older devices but must be downloaded first via Ollama\n",

    "### Required Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Ollama** from https://ollama.ai\n",
    "2. **Download the qwen3:8b model**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ollama pull qwen3:8b\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Install requirements** per the README.md file\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ First-Time Usage Note:\n",
    "**The first time you use the model, it takes longer to load** - don't be discouraged! Subsequent queries will be much faster as the model stays loaded in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why qwen3:8b?\n",
    "- Runs efficiently on older hardware\n",
    "- Good balance of performance and resource usage\n",
    "- Excellent for data analysis tasks\n",
    "- Completely offline operation\n",

    "\n",
    "### Good Question Patterns:\n",
    "- **Be specific**: \"Show glucose distribution for diabetic patients\" vs \"Show glucose\"\n",
    "- **Request context**: \"Compare average BMI between groups\" vs \"Calculate BMI\"\n",
    "- **Ask for visualizations**: \"Plot X vs Y\" or \"Create a histogram of Z\"\n",
    "- **Specify groupings**: \"Analyze by gender\", \"Group by age ranges\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the Local LLM Can Do:\n",
    "- Generate statistical summaries\n",
    "- Create various plot types (scatter, histogram, box plot, etc.)\n",
    "- Perform correlation analysis\n",
    "- Group and aggregate data\n",
    "- Calculate percentages and ratios\n",
    "- Filter and subset data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Notes:\n",
    "- **First query**: May take 30-60 seconds (model loading)\n",
    "- **Subsequent queries**: Much faster (2-10 seconds)\n",
    "- **Complex requests**: May take longer but provide detailed analysis\n",
