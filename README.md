## Why Use This Repository?

- **Privacy First**: All analysis runs locally - your data never leaves your computer
- **Complete Learning Environment**: Pre-configured notebooks with sample datasets
- **Progressive Learning**: Start with traditional methods, advance to AI-powered analysis
- **Medical Focus**: Examples and datasets relevant to healthcare and medical research
- **No System Pollution**: Packages install only into notebook environments, not your system Python

## Prerequisites

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Administrator privileges to install software
- Internet connection for initial setup
- Basic familiarity with using your computer's file system

## Step 1: Install VSCode

### 1.1 Install Visual Studio Code

1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download VSCode for your operating system
3. Install using default options

### 1.2 Install Required VSCode Extensions

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for and install these extensions:
   - **Python** (by Microsoft) - Essential for Python development
   - **Jupyter** (by Microsoft) - Enables notebook functionality

## Step 2: Download This Repository

You have two options to get the repository files. Choose the method that feels most comfortable:

### Option A: Simple Download (Recommended for Beginners)

1. Go to [https://github.com/DrDavidL/local-colab](https://github.com/DrDavidL/local-colab)
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Select **"Download ZIP"**
4. Save the ZIP file to your Downloads folder
5. Extract/unzip the file to your Documents folder
6. You'll have a `local-colab-main` folder with all the notebooks and data

### Option B: Using Git (For Those Comfortable with Command Line)

If you're comfortable with command-line tools or want to learn Git:

1. **Install Git first:**
   - **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - **macOS**: Type `git --version` in Terminal - follow prompts to install if needed
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install git`

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to Documents folder
   cd Documents
   
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/DrDavidL/local-colab.git
   ```

**Why Git is optional**: While Git is a powerful tool for version control, it's not essential for learning data analysis. The simple download method gets you started immediately without additional complexity.

## Step 3: Open the Project in VSCode

### 3.1 Open the Project Folder

1. Open VSCode
2. Go to **File** ‚Üí **Open Folder**
3. Navigate to and select your downloaded folder:
   - If you used **Option A**: Select the `local-colab-main` folder
   - If you used **Option B**: Select the `local-colab` folder

### 3.2 Verify Project Contents

You should see these files in the VSCode Explorer:
- `local_Part_2_Exploring_Data.ipynb` - Traditional data analysis notebook
- `local_gpt_analysis.ipynb` - AI-powered analysis notebook  
- `data/` folder - Contains sample datasets
- `README.md` - This file
- Other configuration files

## Step 4: Set Up Jupyter Environment

**Important**: Do NOT install packages to your system Python. VSCode and Jupyter will handle package management automatically.

### 4.1 Open Your First Notebook

1. Click on `local_Part_2_Exploring_Data.ipynb` to open it
2. VSCode will automatically detect it's a Jupyter notebook

### 4.2 Select Python Interpreter

When you first open a notebook, VSCode may prompt you to select a Python interpreter:

1. Click **"Select Kernel"** when prompted and select `Jupyter` if there is an option for it.
2. Choose **"Python Environments..."** if additionally prompted.
3. Select a Python installation (preferably Python 3.9 or newer)
4. VSCode will automatically set up the Jupyter environment

### 4.3 Let Notebooks Handle Package Installation

**Key Advantage**: The notebooks in this repository are designed to automatically install required packages into the Jupyter kernel environment, not your system Python.

When you run the first cell of each notebook, it will:
- Check for required packages
- Install missing packages automatically into the notebook environment
- Keep your system Python clean and unmodified

## Step 5: Run the Notebooks

### 5.1 Start with the Traditional Analysis Notebook

1. Open `local_Part_2_Exploring_Data.ipynb`
2. Click on the first code cell
3. Press `Shift + Enter` or click the **Run** button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
4. The first cell will automatically install required packages - this may take a few minutes
5. Continue running cells sequentially

### 5.2 Package Installation Process

The first cell in each notebook contains code like:
```python
# This cell automatically installs required packages
import subprocess
import sys

def install_package(package):
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])

# Install required packages for this notebook
required_packages = ['pandas', 'numpy', 'matplotlib', 'seaborn', 'plotly']
for package in required_packages:
    try:
        __import__(package)
    except ImportError:
        print(f"Installing {package}...")
        install_package(package)
```

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Installs packages only for the notebook environment
- ‚úÖ Doesn't modify your system Python installation
- ‚úÖ Automatically handles dependencies
- ‚úÖ Works the same way across different computers

### 5.3 Running Cells

- **Run Single Cell**: `Shift + Enter`
- **Run All Cells**: **Run** ‚Üí **Run All**
- **Run Cells Above**: **Run** ‚Üí **Run All Above**
- **Restart Kernel**: **Run** ‚Üí **Restart** (if you encounter issues)

## Security and Privacy

### Data Privacy
- **All analysis runs locally** - no data is sent to cloud services
- **Sample datasets are anonymized** and safe for educational use
- **Your data stays on your computer** at all times

### Code Safety
- **Review code before running** - understand what each cell does
- **Notebooks are educational** - designed for learning, not production use
- **Package installation is isolated** - won't affect your system Python

### Simple File Management
- **Easy backup** - copy your project folder to backup your work
- **Easy sharing** - zip your folder to share with colleagues
- **Easy updates** - download new versions when available
